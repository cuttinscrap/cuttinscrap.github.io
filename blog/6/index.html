Cancer is a scary word, but attitude is everything.  What type of cancer you ask?  I have Atypical Carcinoid Cancer of the lung.  Rare, I know.  Cutting Scrap was started as a way to keep my mind busy and help me feel productive.  I will try to keep my crafting and my medical updates separate, but I am only human.  In this blog I will post medical updates, family update, and just venting updates.  This blog is my release.  I don’t need opinions on different treatments for my disease. With that being said, support and loving thoughts are terrific!</p></div><div class="card">   <h1>Recovery</h1>
<p><em>December 23, 2016</em></p>
<p>Starting from the beginning of post surgery recovery, Monday.</p>
<p>.....hmmm, I don't remember much from Monday, I was told I was joking with my Dad nice to hear my sense of humor survived the surgery.</p>
<p>Tuesday-Thursday.</p>
<p>I woke up on Tuesday with the worst headache.  Every time someone came in to ask how I was feeling I kept repeating:  &quot;you know my incision isn't bad, but this migraine it's a 10!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyday they kept adding a different narcotic to the list and hoping it would solve the issue by the end of the day, and everyday I said the same thing!</p>
<p>Thursday it was like a light went off in my head.  I knew they were giving me a blood thinner shot in my stomach, so why exactly could I not have Excedrin?  When I asked my nurse she simply told me that she wasn't sure on that and was going to ask the doctor, because she understood what it felt like to have a migraine and it truly is the worst!  We were told that the hospital doesn't carry Excedrin, but if someone went and bought it then a pharmacist could verify it and they could give it to me!</p>
<p>&quot; Say What?  Why am I just now finding out?&quot;</p>
<p>I sent Waylon on a journey,  but while he was gone we had another revelation.  The hospital actually carries Excedrin and the doctors have put in the order so as soon as the floor receives it I can have it! Holy Moly was I mad, it took 4 days for them to figure this out!!</p>
<p>3 hours later I have the Excedrin in had and within a hour I was migraine free.  AMAZING!!!</p>
<p>I was able to make huge strides in my recovery process also.  I could eat and not be nauseous, I could walk in the hall without sunglasses, I  could actually talk to people without wanting to hurt someone, because their voice was killing my head!</p>
<p>Friday = Today.</p>
<p>Woke up feeling decent.  My incision site has become sore, but that is expected.  I have a chest tube in place which hurts quite a bit, but the pain meds, at least there are some that don't cause migraines, are helping with getting me out of bed without help.  I walked a decent length of the unit before becoming winded.  I have ate a normal amount of breakfast and lunch, and got to chat with my brothers and post on social media for the first time.  This has been a big change since B.E. (Before Excedrin).</p>
<p>I did find out that I will be in the hospital till at least Monday or Tuesday, and I find this a difficult discovery.  I'm starting to come to terms with not being with the kids through Christmas, and will look forward to hold my babies again.  I can't thank all of our caretakers enough!  I know both kids have been sick, and Gizmo is a pain, but everyone has been extremely amazing!</p>
<p>In the end, I will have one big scar and a story to tell, but I am strong enough to fight the recovery of a left sleeve lobectomey and survive!  Bring it on, I can take it!</p>
