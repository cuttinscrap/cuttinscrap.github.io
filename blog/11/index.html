Cancer is a scary word, but attitude is everything.  What type of cancer you ask?  I have Atypical Carcinoid Cancer of the lung.  Rare, I know.  Cutting Scrap was started as a way to keep my mind busy and help me feel productive.  I will try to keep my crafting and my medical updates separate, but I am only human.  In this blog I will post medical updates, family update, and just venting updates.  This blog is my release.  I don’t need opinions on different treatments for my disease. With that being said, support and loving thoughts are terrific!</p><div class="card">   <h1>What a day/week</h1>
<p><em>March 15, 2017</em></p>
<p>For the last week I have been dealing with the after effects of the asthma attack.  I have had horrible pain associated with it along side of extreme exhasution.   I dont know what is going on with my body. I dont know why it has to happen now, but I do know it sucks. Today, I called my doctor to give them an update and they sent me to the ER, so frustrating.  ER docs just think my Cancer may be causing negative side effects.   I need to contact my regular doctor to work on pain control.    I just don't know anymore.</p>
<p>On the flip side, this weekend is my benefit in Wapello.  I am extremely grateful and honored that our family was choosen.  My speech is prepared, and I am in the process of making shirts.  If only my body agreeded with the process.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk a little of Wyatt.  I don't know what is going on with him, but it breaks my heart.  He is constantly coming home with yellow and red lights.  He tells me he doesn't like getting in trouble at school.  We talk about it with him.  I do see some bad behavior at home and we definitely see the agression, but i just want to swaddle him up and hold on to his innocence.  I want to know what the right answer is.  We meet with his pediatrition today.   Let's hope he has some answers.</p>
<p>Today is also the 14th anniversary of losing my mom.  I miss her so much, and just want her to know fighting this battle is so hard, but I'm not done with my time with my kids.</p>
<p>This week I am thankful for the inventor of silhouette, my speaking skills, leggings, my kids, fast ER visits, oreos, friends, Waylon, music, and surprise gifts in the mail.</p>
<p>Taking everything one minute at a time...
&lt;3 Rhiannon</p>
