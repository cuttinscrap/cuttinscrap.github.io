Cancer is a scary word, but attitude is everything.  What type of cancer you ask?  I have Atypical Carcinoid Cancer of the lung.  Rare, I know.  Cutting Scrap was started as a way to keep my mind busy and help me feel productive.  I will try to keep my crafting and my medical updates separate, but I am only human.  In this blog I will post medical updates, family update, and just venting updates.  This blog is my release.  I don’t need opinions on different treatments for my disease. With that being said, support and loving thoughts are terrific!</p></div><div class="card">   <h1>Sensory Processing Disorder</h1><p><em>January 4, 2018
</em></p><p>Sensory Processing Disorder.  What does it mean?  It means the the paitents brain takes what we usually can handle like touching different textures, feeling different temperatures, dealing with new situations, doing things out of order, and eating or drinking different substances and they catergorize them as a catastrophic event.  Have you ever seen the movie Inside Out, and how Anger completely looses it.  Well, that is what the brain does when it can't handle a certain situation such as when it snows or the blankets are put on her out of order.
</p><div style="width:50%;height:0;padding-bottom:25%;position:relative;margin:3rem auto;"><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/11tTNkNy1SdXGg" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute; margin:auto;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/disneypixar-disney-pixar-11tTNkNy1SdXGg">via GIPHY</a></div><p>Who is her?  Let me introduce you to my badass, incredibly brave, strong daughter Ayla.  She is 3.  She has been through so much for a child her age, and we think because of what she has been through she developed Sensory Processing Disorder.   Dealing with a child who goes through this is difficult to say the least.  It takes a lot of breathing.   A lot of Occupational Therapy.  A lot of rocking in a chair to help her organize and calm down.  When I know there are things happening at School or we are going to an event that is not the usual for Ayla I prepare my brain to be on alert for cues that she is struggling.  We try to pay extra attention to Ayla in those situations, because we don't want her to loose control of the situation.
</p><p>We breath, we monitor her for oral fixations such as sucking her thumb, be on the look out for her to just lay down in an inappropriate place, and try to find a quiet activity for her to do, even if it means watching annoying toy videos on YouTube.  It is definitely hard and draining to be her parent sometimes, but she is completely worth it!</p></div><div class="card" id="blog-map"><h1>Other Posts</h1><p><em>personal blog</em></p><ul><li><details><summary><a href="/blog/1">November 25, 2016</a>-The Moment life stops...</summary><p>The Moment life stops...</p><p>&quot;You have cancer, a carcinoid tumor in your left lung.&quot;These were the words I heard Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 12:20pm.
