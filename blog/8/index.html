Cancer is a scary word, but attitude is everything.  What type of cancer you ask?  I have Atypical Carcinoid Cancer of the lung.  Rare, I know.  Cutting Scrap was started as a way to keep my mind busy and help me feel productive.  I will try to keep my crafting and my medical updates separate, but I am only human.  In this blog I will post medical updates, family update, and just venting updates.  This blog is my release.  I don’t need opinions on different treatments for my disease. With that being said, support and loving thoughts are terrific!</p><div class="card">   <h1>Becoming an All-star!</h1>
<p><em>January 30, 2017</em></p>
<p>When your life gets put into risk and dying becomes closer than living, everything changes.  The hugs mean just that much more.  The &quot;I love yous&quot; stick.  What goes in your body or surrounds your body now means the world!  When your body fails you and medicine revives you, you are not yet a super hero.</p>
<p>I feel like Deadpool in the hyperbaric chamber.  My body is going through all these chemical changes so that I can become an all-star!   Make no mistake all-star qualities are arriving by the minute.  Little things don't mean as much to me, like getting the laundry done.  Instead I would rather spend the extra time reading one more book at bedtime to my kids.  I now think eating dessert should come first, because you NEVER know.</p>
<p>What happened you ask that forced this change?  Tuesday happened, and by Tuesday night I was taken by ambulance to Barnes hospital.  It took 12 rounds of IV antibiotics to save me.  I'm not going to go into the details, because they are not important to the general public, but what is important is that I survived.  I am still here for my kids, family, and friends.</p>
<p>So how do you change your life for the positive? How do you hang on with everything to see the next day? It's a feeling.  It's putting on a new pair of glasses with the correct prescription strength.  It's putting faith in your medical team, and trusting your gut.</p>
<p>Mostly what got me through that night was saying over, and over again, &quot;Wyatt and Ayla need their Mommy!&quot;</p>
<p>Take care of your body.  Take care of those you love.  It's not worth the risk of what you'd leave behind.</p>
<p>10 positives as promised:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Medicine - truly did save my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waylon - Man I love him, that was a lot to put on him, and a scare drive alone down to St. Louis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My age - I am confident that with my age, I will prevail and kick Cancer's behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netflix and Puzzles - there is only so much you can do in a hospital bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Guardian Angel - because of her I believe I am here.  Miss you Mom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leggings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family and Friend's love and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excedrin - these migraines have been horrendous lately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our shower - man it felt great to take a shower once I got home!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With Love,</p>
<p>Rhiannon</p>
