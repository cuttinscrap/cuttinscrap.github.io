Cancer is a scary word, but attitude is everything.  What type of cancer you ask?  I have Atypical Carcinoid Cancer of the lung.  Rare, I know.  Cutting Scrap was started as a way to keep my mind busy and help me feel productive.  I will try to keep my crafting and my medical updates separate, but I am only human.  In this blog I will post medical updates, family update, and just venting updates.  This blog is my release.  I don’t need opinions on different treatments for my disease. With that being said, support and loving thoughts are terrific!</p><div class="card">   <h1>2 Steps Forward, 1 Step Back</h1>
<p><em>May 26, 2017</em></p>
<p>What a few weeks it has been.  I have been making huge strides in physical therapy.  We have added weights to the workouts and I was allowed to start adding leg and core workouts at home.</p>
<p>Great huh?</p>
<p>You see one of the problems with living with an incurable illness is knowing that sometimes setbacks are going to happen, and this is just a part of the rest of my life.  I have learned to be ok with setbacks.</p>
<p>This week I had my third set of injections, they injected five locations.  I've been having increased symptoms before the injection, and the injection caused some issues in themselves.  My 6th rib has been swollen immensely and isn't healing like it is supposed to. During my injection I asked to see the x-ray of my rib, and it will never line up on it's own.  It is completely broken still with a good inch of misalignment.  I have contacted my surgeon and they will analyze the issue during my 6th month check up in June.  Most likely it will require a surgery to put a plate in to screw my bones back together.</p>
<p>With this discovery my PT has been reduced.  The complications that having a fully broken rib puts is pretty great.  I have been told that most ribs are supposed to heal themselves within 3 months.  I am 5 months post op.  I am at a high risk if I fall to causing a punctured lung, bad time to be clumsy.  I slipped when installing Ayls's carseat and landed hard, definitely caused some extra damage and my pain has increased.</p>
<p>Another surgery is nerve racking and frustrating.  It will have to be a full open surgery which is what starts my recovery over.  Also, my lungs have been super sensitive, and carcinoid syndrome symptoms are increasing.  I am struggling with contact to any sort of pollutions such as smoke or exhaust, but also just fine dust caused when cooking or just allergens in the air.  Waylon has discovered a mask that is high filter level that isn't a full on gas mask.  I am going to try wearing that all the time when outside or cooking.</p>
<p>Fun huh?</p>
<p>Not all superheros wear capes but some do wear masks!  Superhero level upped!!!</p>
<p>I have been thinking about how I can make a difference, and have started getting into baking.  I have wanted to pay it forward for all the help we have recieved.  I have decided to bake cakes and give them away.  I made my first one to give away last night, a chocolate carmel cake.  I gave it away today.  Sometimes, just being able to put a smile on someone else's face makes fighting for my life just a little bit easier.</p>
<p>I'll update you all with a picture in my new mask when it arrives from the great and powerful AMAZON!</p>
<p>&lt;3 Rhiannon</p>
<p>5 Positives</p>
<ol>
<li>My Kids.  They are so sweet and caring, but have the biggest personalities.  I think they have the best mixture of both Waylon and I.</li>
<li>My Organization skills.  We live in a smaller sized house, and I love the challenge of coming up with unique, stylish organization.</li>
<li>Amazon with Prime Shipping :)</li>
<li>Scientist that are studying Carcinoid Cancer and making advances everyday.  I have high hopes that at some point in my life I will be able to reap the benefits of those discoveries.</li>
<li>Youtube - Love watching Cake tutorials!</li>
