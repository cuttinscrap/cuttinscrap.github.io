      <h1>Real Photo transformed into an Applique Wall Hanging</h1>
      <p><em>In Memory of Grandpa Haight</em></p>
      <p>I am a firm believer that there are things in life that remind us of our loved ones, and even help us feel their presence when they are gone.  For my in-laws an Eagle is the representation that reminds us of Grandpa Haight.  He was a great man and I am honored that I got to know him.  I made this wall hanging to represent him flying above his cabin and forever flying in our hearts.</p>
      <h2>Things Needed</h2><img class="left" src="/static/img/projects/3/grandpas_cabin.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>I used this picture of the cabin and Photoshop to eliminate some of the detail to posterize the image.   This gave me a rough outline of different shades and colors to use. Then I mirrored the image, to get the desired orientation for later on in the process. Printed it out at the final dimensions with a colored printer on regular paper to create template.  To get the shapes used for the piecing, I took a sharpie and traced the main outlines of the different shades of color on the posterized design on the copy paper. I shot for large blocks of color, but made sure to leave the organic shapes so that you could recognize the objects later on.  For the fabric I used fat quarters from a local big box fabric store.  It is important to try and match the main background of the fabric to the appropriate shades on the image.  However, patterns on the fabric are ok as long as the main color of the fabric is the right shade of color.   To choose the proper colors I took my print out with me to the store. (Unless you are going for an artistic view of the image then you could mix up what colors you are going for.)  Along with the fat-quarters I used Heat n’ Bond Featherlight iron- on backing. I found it easiest to purchase this by the yard. </p><img class="right" src="/static/img/projects/3/posterized.jpg" alt="posterized layout"/>
      <h2>Layout</h2>
      <p>When designing the layout it is important to preplan.  I used a code that I wrote on my printed out design.  Example: LB1: Light Blue 1, DG1: Dark Green 1.  I then would give each section a two letter code and number.  Multiple areas with the same color would get the same two letter code but a different number.   By numbering the various colors this helped me when moving on to tracing the pieces on the Heat n’ Bond and provided a map to use during assembly.   Make sure you transfer your numbers onto the Heat n’ Bond, so that you know the location of the pieces when you cut them out. When using the Heat n’ Bond you lay it on the image you printed out with the shiny side down and trace.  Trace each shape one at a time, leaving cutting room around the shapes.  When you are assembling you will want some overlap on some of the pieces so make sure to allow extra space during the tracing, but also in certain areas you will want clear crisp lines.  Think ahead and plan how the assembly process will go, and what shapes will be in the foreground vs background.</p>
      <h2>Assembly</h2>
      <p>
        I used my backing for the entire wall hanging as my base to iron on the pieces to.  Make sure that you lay it right side down and iron onto the wrong side.  I also found it easiest to attach the Eagle all at once before attaching him fully to the image.  By doing this I could play with his placement.  Just be careful when ironing that you don’t peal too much of the backing off of the eagle, otherwise you might end up sticking him to your ironing board.  Finally lay all your pieces down and adjust them till you are happy with the final look.  This is a good time to make any extra trimmings if a shape isn’t coming out exactly how you had planned.  When you are happy with the placement, grab your iron.  Make sure not to drag your iron, but instead lift and place it, dragging your iron could scoot your pieces.  Once everything is ironed on, you can begin sewing.  This is where you bring detail and character to your image. 
        
      </p>
      <h2>Learned</h2>
      <p>I am not a Photoshop Pro, and I am not even sure I can walk you through the steps to achieve the posterized image above, but I am one that Googles, and Youtubes everything, until I am able to get the look I am going for.   During the tracing aspect of this project it is important to trace each shape seperately.  I made the mistake to try and trace the entire image all at the the same time without gaps, and that doesn’t allow extra fabric to achieve the layered effect. I also learned that you have to be careful not to over iron spots with the Heat n’ Bond.  I noticed that spots that were over ironed didn’t attach well.    Just like with the quilt that I made using applique, sew slow to get the clean corners and curves, but this is abstract art so don’t be afraid if your lines aren’t perfect. </p>
      <h2>Loved</h2>
      <p>
        There is something about completely designing a project from start to finish, and it turning out exactly how you have it pictured in your mind.  This was a special project, and I really wanted to make sure to capture his cabin while incoorperating the action of the eagle flying.  I love how this turned out and it was recognized immediately when given as a gift. Now that is a win!!!
