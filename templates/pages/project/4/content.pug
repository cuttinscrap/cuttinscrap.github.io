h2 What are Weighted Blankets used for?
p Weighted Blankets can be used for a variety of benefits.  Anytime an adult or child needs deep pressure to assist with grounding a weighted blanket could help. The weight from the blanket helps with the release of serotonin and can help the body naturally release melatonin (the sleeping hormone).  For my family in particular we are using weighted blankets to help with ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, and Anxiety.  So far we have one blanket finished and in testing.  My son, Wyatt, has ADHD and has struggled sleeping through the night for as long as I can remember.  I made him a 6lb weighed blanket about 2 weeks ago now, and he has slept through the night with the exception of one night where his meds were not lined up correctly.  Holy Sleep!!!!!

h2 Cost
p These things can cost a ton.  Just looking on a few different sites I see costs range from $57 up to $230.  $57 isn’t horrible, but by the time you are buying multiple it adds up for kids who are going to outgrow the weight. Most of the blankets this size hovered right at $100 without shipping included in this price. I will break down the cost I spent on mine.  I purchased 5in precut fabric packs off of Amazon for $16.90 (on the high end) $12.90 (on the low side.)  The backing fabric I got at my local big box fabric store for $5/yard.  For the beads, I used Polypropylene Plastic Pellets, I purchased them off of Amazon.  I got 10lb bag for a total of 31.50.   I used 60% of the bag coming in at $18.90.  The total I spent for 1, 6lb weighted blanket is $36.80 plus labor, but I was making this for my kids, so labor is a wash for me.  I will put links at the bottom of this article for the items I purchased off of Amazon.

h2 Process
p To begin this process I laid all of the squares out, making sure the same square wasn’t touching each other.  I didn’t necessarily pay attention to orientation of the squares, because I like the abstract look of the squares going every which way.  I then started attaching the squares in the rows together using a 1/4in seam allowance, making sure to press my seams with the iron after each row was finished. Once all of the rows were completed I sewed the rows together using a 1/4in seam allowance.  I then ironed the top flat and made sure to square up my edges.  I cut my backing fabric to the same size and laid it right sides together.  I went ahead and based in the middle so nothing shifted while I sewed these together.  Also make sure to leave one entire end open to fill later on.  I went around 3 sides with a 1/4in seam allowance, removed all the pins, and turned it right side out making sure my edges and corners were completely turned out.  I pressed the entire blanket to flatten everything out.  Once everything is pressed flat I went ahead and pinned in the middle of every other square.  Next, using my Walking Foot on my sewing machine, I sewed columns by stitching in the ditch down every row.  Now, remove the pins.

h2 Binding
p Then I attached a bias tape around the outside.  I didn’t do this on the very first blanket I made and I found it looked unfinished.  I really like the finished look this gives to the projects.  To prep the bias trape I took a 2.5in precut strip and attached a bund together, putting right sides together and using a 1/4in seam allowance.  I folded 1 side of the tape a quarter of an inch in.  This was to give me a guide later on when folding and attaching it to the quilt.  Then I attached the unironed side of the tape to with the right side facing in to the back of the quilt, sewing around the entire outside.  HOWEVER, I LEFT ENOUGH LENGTH OF BIASED TAPE AND DID NOT ATTACH IT TO THE TOP OF THE QUILT.  This allowed for the filling of the beads. 
p At this point you want to do the math and figure out how much to put in each square (See my process in the math section below.)  I used a kitchen scale to measure out the exact amount and started filling the quilt. After each row is filled take it to the sewing machine and stitch that row closed.  GO SLOW and make sure no beads are in your path during this process.  It might be good to use a heavy duty needle so it doesn’t break easily if you do hit a bead.  I used my fingers to feel the seam as I went and push the beads out of the way.  Repeat this process until the entire quilt is filled.  Once you get to the top be careful, because the beads don’t like to stay put in that top square.  Just sew the top closed using a 1/4in seam allowance.
p Once all the beads are secured go ahead and attach the last of the binding.  Giving the un attached side 3 rolls, the final rolling over the top of the quilt.

h2 Math
p You will need to know these values to start the calculations. 
p Weight of Child (WoC), # of Squares in Quilt, and that there are 16oz in a pound.
p WoC * .1 = (10% of Body Weight) plus 1 or 2 lbs (optional)
p Total weight you want to make the blanket in pounds * 16= Weight of Blanket in Oz
p Weight of Blanket in OZ (Divide by) # of squares= oz/square
p Example:
p I made my son’s blanket 6lbs.  He is 43 lbs and I chose to add the max of 2lbs.	
p 43 *.1= 4.3lbs + 2lbs = 6.3lbs (I rounded down to an even 6lbs)
p 6lbs *16 = 96 oz
p 96/70 (# of squares) = 1.37oz/square

p To double check the math just run it backwards.
p 1.37 * 70=95.9 / 16 = 5.99 lbs (I know the numbers don’t come out to the even 6lbs, but this was close enough for me.)  
p When filling each square if you don’t measure to the exact decimal place with your scale your ending numbers will be off.

h2 What I love
p SLEEP!!!!  As I stated above, my son has been sleeping through the night.  I also love that I was able to save money, but still get him the item he needed to help him be more grounded.

h2 YouTube Video
p If you are a visual learner, I did an Youtube video on this blanket at my channel: Cuttin Scrap it is Episode #2.  Here is the link to the YouTube video: #[a(href='https://youtu.be/nDNhReaEF0A') https://youtu.be/nDNhReaEF0A] Thanks for Reading, and I hope you or someone you know can benefit from the weighted blanket you make.  Please share pictures of your creations and if you find any ways to adjust the idea I would love to know.  Being creative and making these projects your own is always encouraged.  Have fun Cuttin Scraps! Anything is possible if you just attack it one breath at a time!
