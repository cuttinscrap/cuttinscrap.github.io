# Just another Crazy Month.
_July 4, 2017_

Life is busy with two littles and a husband, but I wouldn't change a minute of it.  Everyone of our setbacks has been met with lessons and memories.  I am a stronger because of what I have gone through.  I don't hold on to meaningless fights.

No, I'm not perfect.   I may say or do things that bot everyone agrees with, but when push comes to shove I will do anything for those I love.

Ok enough with the sappiness.

The month of June was busy.  I had a last minute appointment in Iowa City to come up with a plan to evaluate my symptoms.  Having the symptoms is the prime example the Cancer is still in my body.  Confirmation of symptoms means I have Carcinoid Syndrome.  The only way to confirm this is with injections, well blood work too.  Dr. Dillion decided to put me on short acting Octreotide Injections 3X a day.  The prescription was wrote June 8th.  Insurance drug his feet and I was finally able to start the shots on June 17th.

The trick is that I had a overnight 6 month check up in St. Louis with a CAT scan the 15th and Bronchoscopy 16th.  I was checked in and prepped to go under anesthesia, but that all came to a screeching halt when the anesthesiologist brought up the point that I could have a Carcinoid Crisis if I go in with Carcinoid Syndrome.  This could result in very serious situation, and potentially death.  Bronchoscopy off.

Like I said shots were started the next day.  Coincidentally they were approved the same day I called and gave insurance a little nudge. Ok I hate waisting money, because insurance drug their feet to approve the med and let me start a med immediately.

Shots are going good.  They helped my symptoms immediately.  My heart rate has decreased.  They make me nauseous and tired, but help with everything else. Feels good to get it figured out.  The shots would do nothing if I didn't have Carcinoid Syndrome. 

Mixed in with all the craziness, I have continued with physically therapy twice a week.  The great news is they have added actual weight into my workouts, and are kicking my butt.  Having a desease that adds weight no matter what is frustrating, and hard to handle most days.  I refuse to let it take over.  Waylon has committed to helping slap out diet into gear, and I am working out every other day.

Stepping away from medical life for a weekend. We met up with extended family and went camping in Northern Iowa.  It was such and incredible get away.   Waylon and I even had the chance to hop into kayaks.  We needed time out of the walls of our house.  It was a beautiful getaway.  Best part is there is no cell signal up there.  Hello electronic detox!

Unfortunately, when we were literally a minute before loosing cell signal, I got the call that my Grandfather had passed away.   It was unexpected, but he was struggling with some health issues for a few years.  He's reunited with his wife now.

July has started with a bang. 

Since confirmation of Carcinoid Syndrome, I have continued the injections.  I will start monthly long lasting injections at Illinois Cancer Care on the 10th.  These injections are technically a form of chemo.  It is not curative, but it slows the growth down.  I know confusing.  I will have to continue the short acting shots for two weeks after the first long acting shot. From there I will always have to carry the short acting shots as a rescue injections. 

My bronchoscopy that was stopped last month is rescheduled for Friday the 7th.  Based in the results of the CT I am sure they won't see anything.  Just have to check how everything is healing.

One minute at a time.
