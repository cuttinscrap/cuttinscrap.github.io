# The Hard Days have Begun...
_December 5, 2016_


Things are starting to line up, and tomorrow is the day I meet with the surgeon.  Wyatt is going to start all day preschool to try and help him get things under control.  I'm feeling very overwhelmed.  I don't even knowing which way to think.  All I can do is curl up in a ball and melt.  Not feeling an ounce of that strength everyone keeps talking about.   Right now all I feel is a frightening thought of the days ahead.  My baby going to school, the MRI, the surgery, the recovery, the fear of pain.  I don't have strength.  Right now I am a puddle, and a hundreds of people are splashing me in every direction, but my tears replenish the puddle faster than people can take them away.  I'm hurting physically, and emotionally.

The Hard Days have BEGUN!
