# The very bad, no good, hard week.
_2/9/2018_

When I woke up on Monday, I had this pressure in my chest that I just couldn’t shake.  The tears started rolling and I felt as if I was getting jammed into a mini refrigerator by a sumo wrestler.  I was cold, oh so cold.  My mind was racing and I was shaken to the core.  Up until this point I have used past tense words, but if I am being completely honest….it’s still going on. I do feel like I am getting the hand of it, but it doesn’t stop that feeling.  I’m trying not to give it a roll.  I am trying to negate it to being a small one line in my play of life, but it’s like that kid that insists it’s the best, and won’t shut up.  This is very hard.  Being around others that aren’t my husband and my kids is very hard.  Waylon is being amazing this week and is taking care of every need that arises.

## ANXIETY
It a monster that lives just under the skin and every now and then it thinks it needs it’s time to shine. NO.  You don’t get to shine.  You get your two sense, you get to say your peace, but then you need to find that small hole you live in and go back.  I have a life to live and a week is too much time for you to shine through.  You are and ASSHOLE anxiety.

Other than this jerk of Anxiety that thinks it needs to rule my life, I haven’t been doing so great.  The extreme fatigue is debilitating.  I can’t do anything without needing to lay down.  I just have felt off.  I don’t feel well at all.  I have very short bursts, but overall it’s bad. 

This week is one of the worst weeks I have had in a while.  I can’t explain exactly what is going on, but I know it’s not good.  It is terrifying.  I’m trying to be strong, but this week I just can’t.  This is a very bad, no good, worthless, exhausting week.

**One Breath at a Time!**

Love, Rhiannon
