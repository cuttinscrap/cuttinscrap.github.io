# 3 Pieces of brown
_part one_

Today we started episode zero in the Cuttin Scrap studio.  This video featured Rhiannon making a 3 three piece thing.  This thing really has no purpose except that it made us some test footage to use to create a never to be seen episode 0 of Cuttin Scrap.  In this episode we will walk through the process, make mistakes, and try to learn from them as quickly as possible so that we can come on strong with episode one.

In the next episode Rhiannon will not be continuing this project as it is completely useless, other than creating test content.  Stay tuned for better projects.  In the mean time Have Fun and start Cuttin Scrap.
