# Recovery
_December 23, 2016_

Starting from the beginning of post surgery recovery, Monday.



.....hmmm, I don't remember much from Monday, I was told I was joking with my Dad nice to hear my sense of humor survived the surgery.



Tuesday-Thursday.



I woke up on Tuesday with the worst headache.  Every time someone came in to ask how I was feeling I kept repeating:  "you know my incision isn't bad, but this migraine it's a 10!"

Everyday they kept adding a different narcotic to the list and hoping it would solve the issue by the end of the day, and everyday I said the same thing!



Thursday it was like a light went off in my head.  I knew they were giving me a blood thinner shot in my stomach, so why exactly could I not have Excedrin?  When I asked my nurse she simply told me that she wasn't sure on that and was going to ask the doctor, because she understood what it felt like to have a migraine and it truly is the worst!  We were told that the hospital doesn't carry Excedrin, but if someone went and bought it then a pharmacist could verify it and they could give it to me! 



" Say What?  Why am I just now finding out?"



I sent Waylon on a journey,  but while he was gone we had another revelation.  The hospital actually carries Excedrin and the doctors have put in the order so as soon as the floor receives it I can have it! Holy Moly was I mad, it took 4 days for them to figure this out!!

 

3 hours later I have the Excedrin in had and within a hour I was migraine free.  AMAZING!!! 



I was able to make huge strides in my recovery process also.  I could eat and not be nauseous, I could walk in the hall without sunglasses, I  could actually talk to people without wanting to hurt someone, because their voice was killing my head!



Friday = Today.



Woke up feeling decent.  My incision site has become sore, but that is expected.  I have a chest tube in place which hurts quite a bit, but the pain meds, at least there are some that don't cause migraines, are helping with getting me out of bed without help.  I walked a decent length of the unit before becoming winded.  I have ate a normal amount of breakfast and lunch, and got to chat with my brothers and post on social media for the first time.  This has been a big change since B.E. (Before Excedrin).



I did find out that I will be in the hospital till at least Monday or Tuesday, and I find this a difficult discovery.  I'm starting to come to terms with not being with the kids through Christmas, and will look forward to hold my babies again.  I can't thank all of our caretakers enough!  I know both kids have been sick, and Gizmo is a pain, but everyone has been extremely amazing!



In the end, I will have one big scar and a story to tell, but I am strong enough to fight the recovery of a left sleeve lobectomey and survive!  Bring it on, I can take it!
