# A Letter to my Mom...
_February 10, 2017_

Hi Mom,

Where do I start, I miss you.  You already know that.  This has been a rollercoaster, this has all been a rollercoaster and I know your protecting me with the chest straps, but it's time to down grade to the little kid Dragon and not the Tornado.  It would give your arms a break, you wouldn't have to hold on quite so hard.

Who am I kidding, I don't ever want you to let me go.  I only had you for half my life and in a few days I turn 27 meaning I officially will have spend more days without you than with you. 

Ya, I know you never left me, but the physical touch, the warmth of your hug, the smell of your lotion, the feel of your body being close to me.  I could just feel the love radiate.  A feeling I only now understand as a Mother. 

I guess what I want to say most has already been said a million times.  Protect me, give me the strength.  I need the strength, but most of all the humor, the sarcastic tone.  That's who I am at my core, the person that directly reflects you.  If I can't have my humor then I don't have the strength to be me.  I need humor to get through this.  Maybe I should start packing bendable straws in my hospital bags. :)

I love you so much, I know you are the one giving my that guiding hand when stuff gets hard.  Pulling me just to the left of the right side to give me the motivation to get the rest of the way right on my own.    For all that I appreciate you.  I will see you one day, but that day better not be soon, because I'm not ready to give up all this.

So let's crank up some Pink Floyd and jam out the Mom Mobile!  We will rock this!!! 

Love, 
Your Baby
