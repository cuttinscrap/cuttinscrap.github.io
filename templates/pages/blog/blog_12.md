# Universe I am in need of a BREAK!!
_March 24, 2017_

First of all, I want to start out and say thank you to everyone who came out last weekend. It was an amazing weekend and I am very honored to have been the recipient of such support. 

However, since last weekend it has been a challenge. I spent a night in the ER for pain, the following night was up all night puking, followed by last night where my muscles surrounding my lobectomy decided to wake up resulting in a tremendous amount of pain that I couldn't feel before. 

This worn out body is tired. The fight is real.  The fight is tough.  Where is my break? Just a couple days would be nice.

Signed,

Seriously?!?

PS.  10 positives sounds exhausting right now. Let's cut it to 5.

1. I got an appointment for next week with a top Carcinoid Clinic, and was chosen to be part of a clinical trial.  Let's hope United healthcare cooperates.
2. All the love.
3. Leggings..Did I mention I won a pair last weekend!
4. Sprite and Saltines
5. Netflix and Hulu...Yes, I now have both, don't judge. 

P.P.S - "This is Us" is such a deep rollercoaster of emotions!
