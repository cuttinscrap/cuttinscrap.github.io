I read the fairy tales that talked of a princess stranded and waiting for her knight in shining armor to come and rescue her.  I grew up watching the chick flicks with my mom, and the general consensus was the same.  These stories were all fake.  These things never happened right?  Well, I’m no princess.  But I have a knight in shining armor.

Let me talk to you a little about my knight.  He is 5’ 10”.  He has eyes that will melt your heart, and don’t get me started about those muscles.  More importantly he has a heart of gold.  He is always looking out for those around him.  He isn’t afraid to learn something new.  As a matter of fact he is always learning something new, and I love that about him.  He has taken care of me in sickness more than in health, and never complains.  He doesn’t shy away during the scary medical procedures, even when I know it’s making his stomach turn.  He holds my hand.  He sits with me.  He doesn’t eat in front of me when I have to fast.  He makes sure I have good food when I am stuck with hospital food.  He’s the greatest father to our crazy kids.  He keeps up with the crazy and isn’t afraid to let loose.  He takes of my dietary needs without complaining.   He is my husband, my Waylon, and I wouldn’t survive without him.  He is my everything, and I love him forever and ever.
