# Surviving one year at a time...
_March 3, 2017_

There was a part of me who didn't think I would make it to see today.  I heard the diagnosis and my tired, very worn out, overwhelmed body thought it would not happen.  There was NO way I was going to make it to see 27.  I was fairly certain I was not going to survive surgery.  I was fairly certain that I was going to let cancer win. 

I never told anyone.  I never said the words out loud, until now.

* I fought,
* I fought for every tear.
* I fought for every scar.
* I fought for my family.
* I fought for my friends. 
* But most of all, I fought for ME!

So, here I am.  I made it.  I survived another day.  On this day it's not just another day, it's MY DAY!!! I AM SURVIVING ONE YEAR AT A TIME!

I don't know what tomorrow will bring, I don't know what this year will look like, but I do know I WILL be present the ENTIRE year.

10 positives: ME, ALL ME, and some leggings! ;)
