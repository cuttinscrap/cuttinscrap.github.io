# Christmas Time....ehhh
_December 11, 2016_

Christmas is two weeks away and traffic is insane in Peoria.  I am struggling to find the cheer that the holiday season usually brings.



 We found out last week that I am getting sent to Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis since my lung resection requires a specialist to operate.   We get to meet with the surgeon on Wednesday to discuss how the surgery is going to go, along with a possible date for surgery.  **If I have ever had any Christmas wish that meant more to me it would be to have the surgery this year!**


How have I been feeling?  Not so hot.  I have been very exhausted and feel out of breath constantly.  I was hospitalized towards the end of last week due to a pain in my lower right lung area.  We came to the conclusion that the breathing exercises during the MRI last week put my right lung in stress that it caused a muscle strain.  Never thought that could happen, but I also never thought that a 26 year old non smoking adult would be diagnosed with lung cancer.



The support that we have received in the last couple of weeks has been overwhelming.  From texts to check in, donations to our Go Fund Me, and physical help with the kids and around the house I couldn't be more grateful.  However, as much as we have loved the help I think we are going to need a lot of it in the coming weeks.



I've been told I need a little attitude adjustment towards this diagnoses. :)  Ok I admit I am a little bit of a **Negative Nancy.**  I know enough to know that I am going through the stages of grief just receiving the diagnosis, let alone dealing with the symptoms that come along with it. So, I've decided to start to end each blog with the top 10 positives since the last blog.  I might need all of your help to keep me on my word as time goes on.  Think you can do that?  Thanks!



Positives:

1.  My Children's Literature class in college:  I picked up a book to read to Wyatt, "Mom has Cancer," and he seams to be really drawn to it. He is at that age that he understands enough, and yet he doesn't.  He likes to start each day with asking, "Mom do you still have Cancer?"  I think hearing those words out of his little mouth has actually helped me accept it.

2.  Christmas Lights:  As much of a grump and scrooge I have been this season there is one thing I always find magical:  the sparkling of Christmas lights all over town.  Well that and the crazy ones who go a little too far decorating, but I appreciate the laugh.

3.  Leggings:  Lets face it, this might make everyone of my lists. ;)

4.  Awesome understanding Nurses:  I was put in a room with a roommate during my stay, and had a little anxiety knowing Waylon couldn't stay with me.  My nurse jumped into action and informed me my roommate was getting discharged and she would put a block on my room to prevent anyone else being added.

5.  Non Christmas Music Stations on the Radio...Let us face it when you are not in the mood for Christmas nothing makes is worse than those 24/7 Christmas music being blasted everywhere!

6.  Visitors...I have appreciated those that have taken the time out of their day to visit me during this difficult time.  Just those few hours here and there have made me forget for even just a little bit what is going on.

7.  Chocolate, enough said.

8.  Special packages in the mail....I feel like a small child again when I check the mail and there is a surprise package waiting for me.

9.  My kids, again enough said.

10. Waylon, he really has done a tremendous amount for me during this time, and I know it is only going to get worse.  I am really a needy patient when I don't feel good, but the love and care definitely doesn't go unnoticed.



There, I did it, see... 10 things I can be positive about during this time!



Until next time, thanks for all the love!
