# When to pause Netflix?
_January 4, 2018_

There is something about being sick, that also makes you paranoid.  I will start to wheeze or cough up blood and instantly feel the need to retreat into a spiral of Google.  I'm not not a hypochondriac, but I am seriously ill.

Last year, I got what I thought was the flu.  I didn't feel that bad.  When the fever lasted a few days, I called my doctor and was sent to the ER.  At the time I was pissed I was getting sent to the ER instead of the doctor just seeing me.  This all happened shortly after 8 AM.  By 10 I was in the ER, and by 3:30 I was in septic shock.  I was dying.  I was sent by ambulance to St. Louis where I was kept in the ICU.  12 rounds of IV antibiotics later, and I was ok to be sent home.  I was in the hospital for 4 days.  I didn't feel that bad and was dying. 

Now, when I feel like I've been ran over I think, "how bad is this?"  "Can I wait it out?"  And that's usually what I google.  I google how long before I absolutely have to go to the Doctor.  I know, I am sick, I know I take forever to get over things, but do I really have to stop my Netflix binge?

Moral of the story, sometimes you have to suck it up and call the doctor.  Sometimes you have to be polite when they tell you to go to the ER, and sometimes they know what they are talking about.
