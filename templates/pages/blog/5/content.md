# The Date has been set...
_December 17, 2016_

Things have been flying since we met with the surgeon in St Louis.  The surgeon needs a clear picture to decide the right direction during surgery, so they decided to do another repeat bronchoscopy right before surgery.

**Surgery is Monday!!**

I can't believe I'm saying that but we leave tomorrow to head down to St. Louis.  I have the kid's bags packed and will pack ours in the Morning.  It's happening.  I will be tumor free by Tuesday!

I'm nervous about the pain, the hospital food, and possibly ending up with a roommate (meaning Waylon can't stay in the room with me).

As the nerves build, so does the excitement to have surgery over and be on the upside of recovery.

Ten positives:

1. Friends to watch the kids and dog
2.  Leggings...no really I just love leggings
3.  YouTube..we got the wheel barring on our van fixed.  Now it's a lot quieter on road noise.
4.  Chocolate...enough said
5.  Netflix to keep me busy with no commercials.
6.  A washer to clean our sheets after our kind 4 year old climbs into bed and proceeds to pee.
7.  Christmas lights...they are pretty!!!!
8.  Meds to help relax and sleep
9.  Quickness in scheduling of the surgery.
10.  Insurance.  As much as we gripe about it, we would be paying so much more without it.

Surgery time is 10:30am and will post an update as soon as I am able to.  It will take 4-6 hours.  Stay tuned!!!

With much LOVE,
Rhiannon
